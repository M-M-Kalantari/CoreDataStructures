# CoreDataStructures

A collection of small C++ programs focused on **core data structure concepts**, pointer manipulation, and classic computer science problems.  
This repository is intended for learning, practice, and reference.

## 📂 Included Programs

- **customString.cpp**  
  Basic custom string implementation and operations.

- **InfixToPostfix.cpp**  
  Convert infix expressions to postfix using stack concepts.

- **Josephus-Problem.cpp**  
  Classic Josephus problem implementation.

- **LinkedList-OneWay.cpp**  
  Singly linked list implementation.

- **LinkedList-SmartList.cpp**  
  Improved linked list with cleaner logic and utilities.

- **LinkedList-TwoWay.cpp**  
  Doubly linked list implementation.

- **Pointer-Operations.cpp**  
  Pointer basics and pointer-related operations.

- **Queue-&-Stack.cpp**  
  Queue and stack implementation and usage.

- **Sum-without-int.cpp**  
  Calculating sum without using integer arithmetic operators.

## ▶ How to Run (Windows)

This repository includes a helper script: cpp-run.bat


### Steps:
1. Make sure a C++ compiler is installed:
   - **MinGW** or **MSYS2**
2. Ensure `g++` is added to your **PATH**
3. Run `cpp-run.bat`
4. A list of available `.cpp` files will be shown
5. Enter the corresponding number to compile and run the program

> ⚠ If `g++` is not found, please install MinGW or MSYS2 and add it to PATH.
